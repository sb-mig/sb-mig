# AI Agent Instructions

This repository uses **conventional commits** for all commits. When committing, follow the format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<body>
```

Use the following commit types when appropriate:

- `feat` – new features
- `fix` – bug fixes
- `chore` – maintenance work
- `refactor` – code refactoring
- `docs` – documentation changes
- `test` – adding or modifying tests

Other commit types from the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification are also allowed.

Every pull request should contain commits that adhere to this style. The repository is configured with commitlint and commitizen to help enforce these rules.
